## Overview

CredChain India is a national Citizen synchronization platform designed to support a unified electoral roll and Citizen mobility across states. It ensures that every citizen has a single, secure Citizen identity and can vote from anywhere in the country without duplication or fraud.

The system uses a cryptographic Unified ID (UID), a national identity and sync server, and a blockchain based audit ledger to keep Citizen data accurate, tamper proof, and synchronized across all states.

## What it does

Each Citizen is assigned a Unified ID generated from a government ID and date of birth using cryptographic hashing. State Citizen databases are synchronized through a national server, while all Citizen lifecycle events such as registration, migration, and voting are recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger.

This allowss to move between states, update their location digitally, and cast their vote from any polling booth in India without being registered in multiple places.
